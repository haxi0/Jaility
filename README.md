# Jaility
Simple iOS supercharger to be used with TrollStore. Can be used to disable locking after respring, supervise your Device in one click, change badge colours and make your password keys blank. Also respring your Device on any iOS version even if you are on iOS 16!

# Warning
If you used disable lock after respring, and want to enable it back, you need to go to /var/Managed Preferences/mobile and edit the key in com.apple.springboard.plist named SBDontLockAfterCrash to false. If blank password keys doesn't work, try setting your phone's language to English (US) and then try again. Should work. Also, the app doesn't work on iOS 14 and lower!
